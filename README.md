I'm working on making a better control system for a simple prosthetic hand. Right now, it is set up to control robotic fingers using arduino hooked up to servos that control each joint of the hand. 

I used some of the libraries developed by Open Bionics, who have done a great job open-sourcing prosthetic hand components. You can find their work here:
